        Preheat oven to 350° and line two 8" cake pans with parchment paper and
        grease with cooking spray. In a large bowl, cream together butter and
        sugars until smooth. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each
        one, then add vanilla. Add bananas and sour cream and beat until smooth.
      </li>

        In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking soda,
        cinnamon, and salt. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and beat
        until just combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide evenly between prepared pans and bake until tops are slightly
        golden and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to
        35 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let cool 15 minutes, then invert onto cooling rack to cool completely.

        In a large bowl with a hand mixer, beat together cream cheese and butter
        until smooth. Add powdered sugar and beat again until smooth then add
        vanilla and heavy cream and beat until a spreadable consistency.
