    <em>Introduction to making French Croissant  </em>
    <br>
  The French croissant is a masterpiece of patisserie, defined by its iconic crescent shape and a complex, multi-layered interior known as "honeycombing." Unlike standard breads, a croissant is made from a laminated yeast dough, a process that involves repeatedly folding cold butter into a lean dough to create hundreds of alternating layers. When the pastry hits the high heat of the oven, the water in the butter evaporates into steam, puffing the layers apart to create an impossibly airy, shatteringly crisp exterior that gives way to a soft, buttery, and slightly elastic heart.

Achieving the perfect croissant is widely considered a rite of passage for bakers because it requires a precise balance of temperature and patience. The flavor is a sophisticated harmony of high-quality cultured butter, a subtle hint of sugar, and the nuanced tang of a slow-fermented dough. Whether enjoyed plain with a café au lait or sliced open to reveal its delicate "alveoli" (the air pockets inside), the croissant remains the ultimate symbol of French culinary artistry—a labor of love that turns simple flour, water, and fat into a golden, flaky indulgence.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups of Flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup + 1 tbsp Water(lukewarm) </li>
      <li>1/2 cup + 1 tbsp Whole milk </li>
      <li>1/4 cup Sugar </li>
      <li>3 tbsp Unsalted butter (softened)</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Instant yeast </li>
      <li>3 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
      <li>3/4 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp. cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 (8-oz.) block cream cheese, softened
      <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, softened</li>
      <li>4 cups powdered sugar</li>

1 tsp. pure vanilla extract

1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
      </ul>
    <h2> Instructions</h2>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Mix the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Add the milk, water, and softened butter. Knead until the dough is smooth but not overly elastic (about 5 minutes). Shape it into a flat disc, wrap it tightly in plastic, and let it rest in the fridge for at least 2 hours (or overnight).</li>
      <li>Place your cold butter between two sheets of parchment paper. Pound it with a rolling pin into a flat square (about 15cm x 15cm). Keep it cool but pliable; it should be the same consistency as the dough.</li>
      <li>Roll your chilled dough into a larger square (about 25cm). Place the butter block diagonally in the center. Fold the corners of the dough over the butter like an envelope, sealing it completely.</li>
      <li>First Fold: Roll the dough into a long rectangle. Fold it like a letter (top third down, bottom third up). Wrap and chill for 30 minutes</li>
      <li>Second & Third Folds: Repeat this process two more times. Always roll in the direction of the open ends. Between each fold, chill the dough to keep the butter from melting.</li>
      <li>Place croissants on a baking sheet. Let them rise in a draft-free spot at room temperature (around 24°C to 26°C) for 2 hours. They should look puffy and wobble like Jell-O when you shake the tray.</li>
      <li>Brush lightly with egg wash. Bake at 200°C (390°F) for about 15–20 minutes until they are a deep, golden mahogany</li>
      
    </ol>
